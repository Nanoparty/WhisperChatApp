### Summary

Whisper is an online chat application built with a React front-end and a Firebase backend database.

### Motivation

The purpose of this project was to flex my skills with react and practice using Firebase as a backend solution as well as build something cool and interactive I could share with my friends and other online.

### Getting Started

Click the demo link or clone/download the repository on your local machine.

To run the project locally, you will need to create your own firebase project and setup the config for it in firebase.config.js.

Firebase projects must have email authentication enabled for signup and signin.

### Features

To begin each user must create an account with which to send messages. If you have an account already you can login with your email and password. When you make a new account you can choose your username and password.

This messaging web app allows as many users as you'd like to all communicate in real time in a single chatroom.
